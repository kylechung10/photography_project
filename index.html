          Amsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands, built more than 60 miles of
          canals. This makes about 90 islands and 1,500 bridges. There are four
          main concentric half-circles canals known as, <i>Grachtengordel</i>,
          three of the canals are mostly for residental development and the
          fourth, outer canal called <i>Singelgracht</i> is used for defense and
          water management. As seen in the picture, many of the canals have bike
          paths and automobile streets running along them.

          Zaanse Schans is the windmill village right outside of Amsterdam. The
          change of scenery was quick as after about a 15 minute drive from the
          busy city of Amsterdam I was greeted open lands and windmills. Each
          windmill has its own unique name
          <i
            >De Huisman, De Gekroonde Poelenburg, De Kat, Het Jonge Schaap, De
            Os, De Zoeker, Het Klaverblad, and De Bonte Hen.</i
          >
          Every single windmill performs a specific task such as a mustardmill,
          sawmill, dyemill, or oilmil. Windmill operators can open or close the
          sails to control the speed of the windmill depending on the strength
          of the wind, and also rotate the direction depending on the direction
          of the wind.

          This photo was taken inside one of the sawmill windmills within Zaanse
          Schans. Volunteers keep the windmills running everyday allowing
          everyone to come visit and experience these wonderful structures. Here
          you can see the various parts that a windmill operator might need to
          maintain these machines. Those wooden shoes are called <i>clogs</i>,
          and they are wooden shoes meant to keep the moisture out when working
          out in the damp fields.

        <p>
          The Muiderslot is a castle located southeast of Amsterdam. The castle
          was constructed in 1280 by Count Floris V. It was used to enforce a
          toll on traders that passed along the trade route to Utrecht. It is a
          small castle with a surrounding moat, and it measures around 32 by 35
          meters with a brick wall around 1.5 meters thick. Around 100 years
          later it was rebuilt in the same spot using the same plan, by Albert
          I, Duke of Bavaria. Currently, it is a national museum that was
          restored to replicate how it looked in the 17th century.

          This is the Gouda city hall. Gouda is the province of South Holland,
          holding a population of around 72,000 people. It is famous for its
          Gouda cheese, stroopwafels, smoking pipes, and 15th-century city hall.
          It is mostly famous for its Gouda cheese market that is held every
          Thursday. Cheese is brought, weighed, and auctioned off at the market,
          making it a popular tourist attraction.

          The Sint Janskerk is located in Gouda, and is a large Gothic church.
          It is famous for its stained glass windows, for which it has been
          placed on the UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and
          Cultural Organization) list of Dutch monuments. The church is
          dedicated to John the Bapist, the patron saint of Gouda, and was
          constructed during the 15th and 16th centuries. In 1552 a large
          portion of the church was burnt, and rebuilt larger than before. The
          famous stained glass windows were made by the brothers Dirk and Wouter
          Crabeth I.
